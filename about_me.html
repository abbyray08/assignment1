    <h3> Our trip to Italy </h3>
    <p>A couple weeks ago my husband and I did a little tour of Italy. We spent a
        few days in Venice where we wandered through the tight alleyways and
        sipped wine on the canals. Then we took a train to Italy's west coast
        to hike and eat Monteressina cake in Cinque Terre. Following some phenomenal
        frito misto, we took another train to Florence and soaked up some history
        and more wine. Florence is most people's favorite, but we much preferred
        Cinque Terre and Venice!

    <h3> Ports Cafe</h3>
    <p>Though I have many favorite restaurants, one that I've
        returned to time and time again is <a href="https://portscafe.com/" target="_blank">Ports Cafe</a> in Geneva,
        NY. Their specials menu
        changes every day producing exciting, inventive, and delicious results
        and the atmosphere is always cozy.

        This isn't particularly special, but I do love pizza. I don't need
        anything fancy, a plain pie, as we call it in NJ, with a coke will do
        just fine. But I do also love a white pizza or a grandma pie.
